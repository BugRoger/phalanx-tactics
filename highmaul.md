## [Kargath Bladefist](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=87444)
Kargath Bladefist is a fairly straightforward fight that requires moderate coordination. Throughout the encounter, Kargath will use the Chain Hurl ability to pick up the five nearest players and fling them into the stands of the Coliseum where they can engage the enemies in the audience. The most dangerous mechanic in the encounter is Berserker Rush. It can only be stopped by the target's death or by kiting Kargath through an active Flame Pillar

### Recap
  * 2 tanks, 3 healers
  * Spread out 7y for Blade Dance
  * Move the fuck out of his way for Berserker Rush
  * Pull into the flaming pillars
  * Chain Hurl will throw closest 5 on the stands. Kill stuff. Alertnate tanks with debuff.
  * Tank switch on 2 stacks of Impale. Debuffed tank stands closest

## [The Butcher](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=87447)
The Butcher encounter is a simple DPS check with little movement, but requires a lot of coordination. The trickiest mechanic is the  Cleave/ Gushing Wounds interaction. 

### Recap
  * 2 tanks, 3 healers
  * Tanks stack up. Switch when Tenderizer falls off
  * 2 even melee groups to soak Cleave. One ranged that moves in an out at 3 stacks. Hunters preferred
  * 1 ranged clump for Bounding Cleave
  * Hero at 30% when the boss gets Frenzy. Soakers switch at 4 stacks now

## [Brackenspore](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=87441)
The Brackenspore encounter is an add-heavy fight that requires intelligent target prioritization and heavy movement. Keep mushroom buffs going while killing adds and set fire to shit.

### Recap

  * 2 tanks. Taunt at 4 stacks of Rot. OT behind the boss because of Necrotic Breath.
  * Fungal Flesh Eater top 1 priority. Kill ASAP. Interrupt rotation with at least 3 people.
  * Block Spore Shooters. Be within 8y of it, Hunters.
  * Anything that stands in Creeping Moss gets healed. 2 players take Flamethrowers and toast that shit.
  * Healers top of MT before Necrotic Breath. No healing possible while it casts
  * Heal up blue and green shrooms to 100% to trigger. Keep healed. Green does insane AoE heal. Blue gives heroism and mana regen.

  * Kill order: Flesh eater > Mind Spore > Shooter

## [Tectus](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=87446)
The central theme of the fight is that, when killed, Tectus splits up into two copies of himself, which have identical abilities to Tectus. Then, when these copies of Tectus are killed, they each split up into 4 copies, again with almost identical abilities, which must also be killed

### Recap

  * 2 tanks. Boss in the middle of the room.
  * Ranged camp moves counter-clockwise on the edge of the room. Earthen Pillar to the left. Crystaline Barrage to the right.
  * Offtank picks up adds. Kill Earthwarpers. Cleave Berserkers. Stun when casting Gift of Earth. Intercept projectiles if it goes through.
  * Kill boss during Tectonic Upheaval. 
  * Tank shards slightly apart from each other. Split one. Maintain strategy.
  * All 4 motes on one tank. Focus and cleave them. Stay alive. Then second shard.
  * All bosses must be damaged to reduce Accretion stacks

## [Twin Ogron](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=78237)
The Twin Ogron encounter requires heavy movement and presents a wide variety of mechanics for players to master. Most of these mechanics are energy-based, and can be predicted by watching the two bosses' energy bar

### Recap

  * 2 tanks. One boss each. Tank close to each other.
  * Move Phemos away for Whirlwind
  * Ranged camp move away from Shield Charge by Pol
  * Move toward the center of the room when dodging Pulverize 
  * Stack on Phemos for Enfeebling Roar
  * Tricky ability alignment is Enfeebling Roar and Pulverize. Need to move together with the tank towards middle.

## [Ko'ragh](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=87445)
The Ko'ragh encounter requires heavy movement and careful coordination of a small group of players who must manage a special task in the fight. Healing and DPS demands on this encounter are high, and raids will want a good balance of physical and magical type damage-dealers to deal with the central mechanic of the fight, the Nullification Barrier/Rune of Nullification.

### Recap
 
 * Casters need to remove the Nullification Barrior buff from the boss
 * When he is recharging his barrier the raid clumps behind a Suppresion Field to get the adds inside of it. Then kill them.
 * Orbs falling from the ceiling need to be soaked. Predefined players will charge up inside in the Nullification Barrier. Spamheal them.
 * Spread out 5y because of Fire debuff
 * Arcane debuff on the tanks. Switch and run out. Leave a trail of ouch. Don't kill the raid.
 * Stay 30y away from the Frost Orb
 * Healing CDs for the Shadow debuff

## [Imperator Mar'gok](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=87818)
The Imperator Mar'gok encounter is long, with four phases, and very complex. 

Mar'gok begins the fight with a certain set of abilities, and as he falls below various health thresholds, he will empower these abilities with additional effects by activating Runestones around the room. Between the second and third phase, and the third and fourth phase, players will have an Intermission where they must deal with a variety of add spawns while Mar'gok is immune to damage.
